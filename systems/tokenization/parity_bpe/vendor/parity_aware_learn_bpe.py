"""Vendored, near-verbatim copy of the CORE fitting functions from the
official Parity-aware BPE implementation:

  Foroutan, Meister, Paul, Niklaus, Ahmadi, Bosselut & Sennrich,
  "Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in
  Tokenization" (ACL 2026, aclanthology.org/2026.acl-long.342).
  Code: github.com/swiss-ai/parity-aware-bpe (MIT license), file
  parity_aware_bpe/parity_aware_learn_bpe.py, commit as of 2026-08-19.

Per explicit user instruction, this project REUSES the official algorithm
implementation directly wherever possible, rather than reimplementing it
(contrast systems.tokenization.superbpe.model, which deliberately
reimplements its paper's algorithm from scratch in this project's own style
-- a DIFFERENT choice made for a DIFFERENT baseline, not a contradiction).

WHAT'S KEPT, VERBATIM: get_vocabulary, _get_vocabulary, pre_merge,
update_pair_statistics, get_pair_statistics, replace_pair, prune_stats,
replace_pair_dict, open_file, preprocess_input_data, learn_bpe (the "base"
Parity-aware BPE variant), select_language_index, learn_bpe_moving_window
(the "window" variant) -- copied unmodified, including code paths this
project's own caller never exercises (the num_workers>1 multiprocessing
branch, is_dict/total_symbols/bpe_file/ratio handling) so the vendored
functions remain a faithful, literally-callable copy rather than a
selectively-trimmed one.

WHAT'S DROPPED: create_parser and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` CLI
driver -- this project integrates via its own Config/Trainer/CLI scaffold
(see ../train.py/../cli.py), not via file-path argparse flags, so the CLI
layer has no role to play here. Everything it did (opening --input/--dev as
UTF-8 file objects, building the Whitespace+ByteLevel pre_tokenizer,
dispatching to learn_bpe vs. learn_bpe_moving_window) is instead done by
../model.py's own fit_parity_bpe, using in-memory io.StringIO "files" (these
functions never touch a real filesystem path except in the num_workers>1
branch, which this project never triggers) built from this project's own
{lang: text} group data instead of real corpus files on disk.

ONE STRUCTURAL DEPENDENCY TO KNOW ABOUT: get_vocabulary references a bare
module-level name `pre_tokenizer` (an HF tokenizers pre-tokenizer object) --
in the original CLI, that name is assigned inside the `if __name__ ==
"__main__":` block before learn_bpe ever runs. Since that block is dropped
here, ../model.py's fit_parity_bpe sets it explicitly as a module attribute
on this vendored module (`vendor.pre_tokenizer = ...`) before calling
learn_bpe/learn_bpe_moving_window -- a live global lookup, so this works
correctly with zero changes to the function bodies below.

NO CHECKPOINT/RESUME: unlike every other from-scratch fitter in this
project (see e.g. systems.tokenization.superbpe.model's own checkpoint
support, added after a real multi-timeout SLURM incident on this exact
project), learn_bpe/learn_bpe_moving_window below are single monolithic
calls with no pause/resume hook of any kind -- a real operational risk for
a long real-vocab-scale fit that times out mid-run, with no principled way
to add one without modifying this vendored code (which would undercut the
point of reusing it verbatim). See ../model.py's own module docstring for
how this project's job script (jobs/train_parity_bpe.sh) currently handles
that risk (short answer: it doesn't, yet -- flagged there for visibility).
